# LivaNova

LivaNova is a global medical technology company that creates breakthrough treatments for conditions affecting the head and heart. The main focus of this project is drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients, who have a disorder in which nerve cell activity in the brain is disturbed, causing seizures.

With the common understanding that different regions and different hospitals can have different number of DRE patients, the overall objective for this project is to use public data resources to estimate the number of drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) patients in the specified area by two dimensions: hospital (where people seek treatment for) and zip code (where people live) for the company to save cost of paying external data providers and optimize selling VNS devices to targeted hospitals treating DRE patients based on feasible recommendations
